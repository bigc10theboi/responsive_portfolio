        <p>I grew up in Minnesota, spending most of my childhood in New Hope. Growing up with two older brothers made me competitive, always trying my best to do as well as they did in school and sports. We all played football, soccer, and hockey while all attending the same elementary and high schools. These days I spend the winter months still playing ice hockey when I can, the summer is spent on disc golf, while I try to hike and stay active year round.</p> 

        
  
        <p> After graduating from Cooper High School, I spent a year at North Hennepin Community College before dropping out. Trying to navigate my way through life's ups and downs I moved to St. Cloud for several years. After awhile I moved back to the Twin Cities to be closer to my family. Working reatil for several years and several companies I have started to realize that profession is not where my passions lie. Experiencing the volatile and uncertain work world with the Covid virus I decided it was time for a change.</p>
          
          
         <p>Since a young age I've had an affinity for technology, spending countless hours on video games. So naturally after experimenting with coding in high school and looking into various coding bootcamps I decided to move into the web development field. Utilizing the skilsl I leanr in this bootcamp I look forward to the next building block of my future success.</p>
