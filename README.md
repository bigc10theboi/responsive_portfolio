# responsive_portfolio
Homework assignment number two

Applying bootstrap along with CSS this application was built to demonstrate my knowledge in applying those technologies to a responsive portfolio detailing me and my interests.
There is navbar with functional links to the other pages which appears across the pages
The index page has an image with a personal desrciption.
The portfolio page is designed to hold a gallery of images.
The Contact from has three different inputs which are required to hit submit(although submit has no function).
This project was interesting to try and get all the pieces to fit correctly and interact with each other properly.
